#  Data Analysis and Visualization with Python
 In this project, I use various Python libraries and techniques to perform a comprehensive data analysis and visualization on two CSV files that contain information about the prevalence of various mental disorders across different countries and years. I explore the dataset to identify interesting patterns and trends, such as the correlation between eating disorders and bipolar disorders. I also detect and remove outliers using boxplots and IQR method, and test hypotheses using scipy and Pearson correlation. I communicate and interpret my findings and insights using seaborn and matplotlib. This project showcases my data analysis and visualization skills and my problem-solving abilities.
